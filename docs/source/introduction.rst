Introduction
=============
scRFE (single-cell identity definition using random forest modelling and recursive feature elimination) is a python package that uses a one vs all random forest classifier with recursive feature elimination to identify the set of genes necessary and sufficient to describe the different features of your single-cell RNA sequencing data.

scRFE is still under development. A preprint of our scRFE paper will be available soon on bioRxiv. All datasets used with scRFE are available on Figshare.

scRFE is produced by CZ Biohub.
